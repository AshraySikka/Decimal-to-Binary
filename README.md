# Decimal-to-Binary

This Python script takes a **decimal number** as input and converts it to its **binary representation** using a simple loop and basic arithmetic.

## 💡 What It Does

- Prompts the user to enter a **non-negative integer**.
- Calculates its binary equivalent manually (without using built-in functions).
- Displays the result.

## 📁 File

- `decimal_to_binary.py`: Contains the binary conversion logic.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run the script:

```bash
python decimal_to_binary.py
